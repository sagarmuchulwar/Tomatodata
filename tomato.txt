## Analysis of Tomato plant growth under different light condition

Three plants ( A, B and C ) were exposed to different Light conditions

Plant A was exposed to 12 hours of light every day
Plant B was exposed to 8 hours of light every day
Plant C was exposed to 4 hours of light every day


We draw some interesting plots here in this Repo.

```{r}

library(ggplot2);
library(dplyr);
library(stringr);


dim(tomatodata)
names(tomatodata)
head(tomatodata)
str(tomatodata)

```


##Plot of Tomato plant height

```{r}
g1 <- ggplot(data = tomatodata, aes(x=tomatodata$"Days", y=tomatodata$"Height", color=tomatodata$Height))
g1 = g1 + geom_point();
g1 <- g1 + labs(title="Tomato Plant Height", x="No. of Days", y="Height")
print(g1)

```

## plot of Height Vs Leaves

```{r}
g2 <- ggplot(data = tomatodata, aes(x=tomatodata$"Height", y=tomatodata$"Leaves", color=tomatodata$Height))
g2 = g2 + geom_point();
g2 <- g2 + labs(title="Height Vs Leaves", x="Height", y="Leaves")
g2

```

## Plot of Tomato Plant leaves

```{r}
g3 <- ggplot(data = tomatodata, aes(x=tomatodata$"Days", y=tomatodata$"Leaves", 
color= tomatodata$Height, horizontal='true'))
g3 = g3 + geom_point();
g3 <- g3 + labs(title="Tomato Plant Leaves", x="No. of Days", y="Leaves")
g3

```

## Box Plot

```{r}

b <-plot(tomatodata$Plant, tomatodata$Height)
